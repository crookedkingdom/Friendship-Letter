# Friendship-Letter
This is a small interactive web project featuring a red envelope that opens and closes to reveal a heartfelt message, with animated hearts and sparkles floating around.

The project is based on the original concept and code from https://heryyy.github.io/pink-envelope/. I used that as inspiration but made significant modifications, changing the font, changing color scheme, increasing the number of hearts and sparkles, customizing animations, and adjusting the layout to fit my own style.

I built Friendship Letter as part of my learning process in web development, practicing HTML, CSS animations, and JavaScript to create smooth interactive effects. It helped me improve my skills in styling complex UI elements and working with animations.

This envelope animation is a creative way for me to combine coding practice with design, and to personalize an existing idea into something unique.
